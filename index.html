            <p class="sectionSubTag text-sm">Everybody experiences highs and lows. It's easy to become complacent, to lose motivation, and to accept the circumstances we've become accustomed to; No matter how much we dislike it, no matter how much it hurts us, we dwell silently in agony because we don't feel like fighting the battle to change. Join us in striving together to be happier, to enjoy life more individually and collectively. Interaction and socialization will reinforce that you ARE NOT ALONE. You are valuable. You deserve to become your best self.  </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-sm">Aging & complacency both contribute to our deteriating physical health and appearence. No matter what age we are, many of us unintentionally remove laboring tasks from our lives until we have little to none at all. Our goal here is to promote activity, sport, and exercise in some capacity. Walking, jogging, running, yoga, sports, swimming, and many forms of games. Utilizing our body through competition will universally strengthen our health, physically, mentally, and emotionally.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-sm">Whether we live in a city, the suburbs, or out in the country, it is very common for neighbors to not speak or know each other. Too frequently we harbor unjustified thoughts or stereotypes about people we've never truly given a chance. I'm not suggesting everybody will become best friends or exchange birthday/christmas presents. What I am theorizing, is becoming friendly, cordial, and respectful of each other. Learning each others names or basic info, like each others family, job, interests, or who you live with. Developing comfortability in communication, whether greeting each other, dealing with living situations that arrise, or trusting each other to keep an eye out for loved ones or property in the neighborhood.</p>
